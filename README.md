Welcome to the Hangman Game! Dive into this classic word-guessing game where you strive to unveil a mystery word before the hangman is drawn completely. Test your vocabulary and intuition against the ticking clock of incorrect guesses.

## How to Play

1. At the start, a random word is chosen, and blanks corresponding to the letters of the word are displayed.

2. Your goal is to guess the word, one letter at a time.
   
3. For each incorrect guess, a part of the hangman figure is drawn.

4. The game proceeds in the following manner:
   - If you guess a letter correctly, it will be revealed in the blanks.
   - For each wrong guess, the hangman figure is progressively drawn.
   - You are allowed up to 6 incorrect guesses before the game ends.

5. To win, correctly guess all the letters in the word before the hangman figure is fully drawn. If the hangman is completed before you guess the word, it's game over.

1. Ensure that you have Python installed on your computer.

2. Clone the repository or download the provided game code.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the game directory.
