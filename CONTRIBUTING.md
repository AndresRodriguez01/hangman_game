## Code Contribution Guidelines

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the main Hangman Game repository to your GitHub account.

2. **Branch Creation**: Always create a new branch from the main one. Ensure your branch has a descriptive name indicative of the changes you intend to introduce, e.g., `feature/new-word-database`, `bugfix/issue-rendering`, etc.

3. **Code**: Introduce your changes, ensuring your coding style aligns with the project's standards and best practices.

4. **Testing**: If applicable, write tests covering your code changes. Ensure all pre-existing tests still pass successfully.
